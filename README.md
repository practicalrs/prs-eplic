# Practical RS Esoteric Programming Languages Interpreters Collection

This interpreter project is a part of my research project titled "Rust-Infused Compilers" - you can read more about it [here](https://practicalrs.com/articles/). I want to learn how to write language compilers/interpreters.

What you find in src is written by me, but in many cases I took an inspiration from other projects. I'm giving links in source code. So if you see some algorithm that looks familiar, than it means that I made "own" reimplementation of it ;)

What you find in test_data is just a bunch of test programs for particular languages. I made dir names from urls so you can find original source of test programs.
